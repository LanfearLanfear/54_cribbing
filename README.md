This repository contains a list of potential cribs for the red header of Page 54 on the Liber Primus.
The following assumptions were made:
1. The first latter on the page is 'A'.
2. The second word starts with a consonant.
3. The second word is a noun.
4. The second word is singular.

The list of cribs is based on the wordnet2022 list from NLTK.
I do not take any responsibility for completeness of the list or correctness of the underlying code.

The indices shown in the lists (Indices, Plaintext minus ciphertext, Plaintext plus ciphertext, Ciphertext minus plaintext) are just for the first full word and not the entire red header.
If you want to see the changes for the entire red header you have to add a 0 yourself (because it is assumed that the first ciphertext letter 'A' is the same as the plaintext letter).
