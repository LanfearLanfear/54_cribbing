This repository contains a list of potential cribs for the red header of Page 54 on the Liber Primus.
The following assumptions were made:
1. The first latter on the page is 'A'.
2. The second word starts with a consonant.
3. The second word is a noun.
4. The second word is singular.

The list of cribs is based on the wordnet2022 list from NLTK.
I do not take any responsibility for completeness of the list or correctness of the underlying code.
